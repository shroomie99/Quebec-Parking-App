NOTE:
(1)
COTE: Droite = ODD house 
COTE: Gauche = EVEN house

(2)
coordinates of street are a vector from smallest to largest address. 

==
Use knowledge of ODD and EVEN houses && that coordinates are an address vector -> to find the coordinate that is perpendicular left to the street.

How to identify whether a street will rise or fall in numbers?

Limitations:
COTE and SENS_CIR cant be used to identify which coordinate is perpendicular left.
