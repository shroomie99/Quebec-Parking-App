## Montreal Parking App Overview ##

App Name:
Montreal Parking App

Goal:
To assist users in finding free legal parking spots in Montreal based on various criteria.

Brief Description:
The app uses the vehicle's parking sticker designated zone, among other parameters, to search through a Montreal street parking database. It provides locations where the user can legally park their vehicle.

How It Works:
- User enters the vehicle's parking sticker designated zone, if available.
- User allows the app to access their live location.
- The app displays a map with parking zones:
   -- Green Zones: Allowed to park
   -- Red Zones: Not allowed to park

Databases Utilized:
1) Quebec city street parking (select CSV/geoJSON): https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9c11aab8-419c-4a7e-8bdc-95b5395a9f32 

2) Montreal street parking signs (Select only the "Signalisation- Stationnement" file in format CSV/geoJSON): https://donnees.montreal.ca/dataset/stationnement-sur-rue-signalisation-courant

3) Montreal street sides (Select only the CSV/JSON dataset)
 https://donnees.montreal.ca/dataset/geobase-double


User Input Parameters:
- Current date and time 
- User's current location (via GPS)
- Parking duration
- Parking sticker designated zone (if applicable)

Transformations:
The app will process the input parameters against the street parking databases to determine legal parking spots.

In the Montreal street parking dataset. 
- identify the sign's position (from latitude & longitude)
- direction sign points on a street side (from position_pop)
- identify signs restrictions (regarding date, time, parking duration) for non-resident's
- identify signs allowances for holders of a specific zone residents-only parking sticker (regarding date, time, parking duration)
- if sign is still active

Transformation output:
- 2 latitude & longitude coordinates for permissible zones * (quantity of times this happens)

Output:
A map indicating permissible parking areas based on the user's provided criteria.

Additional Notes:
The app requires internet connectivity to access real-time data and GPS for location tracking. It aims to simplify the parking experience in Montreal, taking into account the complex parking regulations of the city.

Future features:
- Provide option for users to see only free parking spots OR both free & paid parking spots.
- process correctly curved street (i.e. streets with multiple edges), currently treated as a straight line
- parse sign RPA dataset for max parking duration permitted 
- Add sign rules from signs identified by : "rule_type : Impact sign directly above" to parent sign. Parent sign can be found by using POTEAU_ID_POT (needs same ID) and POSITION_POP (needs to be either 1 below or above the identified sign). 


Example cases:
1) 14h,01-10-2024, 45.574396,-73.54696, greater than 4 hours, none
2) 6h, 01-10-2024, 45.574396,-73.54696, less than 4 hours, 22
any) 30 minuture intervals, 15 days intervals, random coordinates, greater or less than 4 hours, zone 1 to 100
